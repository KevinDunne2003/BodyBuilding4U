					<h1>What is bodybuilding?</h1>
					<p>Bodybuilding is the practice of enhancing one's physical form. This is achieved mainly through excercise and specifically weihtlifting with the growth of muscles being paramount.Competitive bodybuilding is in effect the pursuit of the ultimate physique.</p>
						<p> In saying this, the majority of people think bodybuilders are 'mass monsters' who's physique does not appeal to them at all. This is a very small amont of highly competitive bodybuilders working in a niche market. In fact anyone who is trying to improve or sculpt their body can be considered a body builder.

					<p>The physical culture of muscle-building has attracted followers for many years; well before the advent of competitive bodybuilding as we know it today.</p>

						<p>Followers of the iron game will know that bodybuilding in its popular form began in earnest in the 1890s with the arrival of Mr. Eugene Sandow, whom the Mr. Olympia statue is modelled on.</p>

						<p>However, weight training as a general athletic activity was initially practiced as a means to gain strength and measure power in ancient Egyptian and Greek societies. These societies would primarily use stones of various sizes and weights (a practice that would occur in one form or another throughout history) in their quest for body transformation. The celebration of the human body through muscular development was, in fact, one of the Greek ideals.</p>

						<p>Physical culture (distinguishable from bodybuilding per se due to the lack of specific physical display as an end goal) can be traced back to 11th century India where stone dumbbell weights, known as Nals, were lifted by those wanting to develop their bodies to enhance health and stamina to help overcome the challenges of daily life. Gyms were commonplace in India during this period, and by the 16th century, weight training is thought to have been India's national pastime.</p>

						<p>There was to be a long period between the 16th century physical movement in India and the beginning of bodybuilding (defined as training and dieting to develop one's body specifically for exhibitive purposes) as we know it today.

					<p>Mr. Olympia is the title awarded to the winner of the professional men's bodybuilding contest at Joe Weider's Olympia Fitness & Performance Weekendâ€”an international bodybuilding competition that is held annually by the International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness (IFBB).</p><p> Joe Weider created the contest to enable the Mr. Universe winners to continue competing and to earn money. The first Mr. Olympia was held on September 18, 1965, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York City, with Larry Scott winning his first of two straight titles.<p>
						<p>The record number of wins is eight each by Lee Haney (1984-1991) and Ronnie Coleman (1998-2005). Mamdouh 'Big Ramy' Elssbiay currently holds the title. Famous actors such as Arnold Schwarzenegger also won the conmpetition in the 1970s and 1980s. This was the precedents for the creation of the movie 'Pumping Iron' in which the buildup to the 1975 Mr.Olympia in Pretoria, South Africa was documented. This was his first cameo, bringing the attention of the public to himself but also to the competition.

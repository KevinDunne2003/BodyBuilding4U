					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>I had never read a bodybuilding magazine before I started working at one. It was December 1992, I was a broke-ass graduate student, and out of pure luck landed a part-time copyediting job at Muscle & Fitness.</p>

						<p>I knew a few of the biggest names—Arnold and Franco and Lou Ferrigno—but had no sense of the history of the iron game, and how for the past century it had influenced our notion of what a guy could look like.</p>
						
						<p>My ignorance prevented me from understanding that I had arrived at a key moment.
						Once I realized how much there was to know, I was hooked. I now have a shelf full of books covering the rich, strange, and often hilarious history of the pursuit of muscle.</p>
						<p>Even better, I have friends who've seen more and know more, and were happy to share their insights</p>
					
					
					<h4>Arnold Schwarzenegger</h4>
					<img class="arnold_history"  src="Images/Arnold4.jpg" alt="Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1980s">;
					
					<p>Arnold wasn't the biggest or best-conditioned bodybuilder of the late 1960s. Sergio Oliva, a Cuban émigré, was bigger, and guys like Bill Pearl looked leaner and sharper.</p>

					<p>But Arnold was the first one that people I knew talked about.</p>

					<p>I can remember kids at school describing him in a talk-show appearance. “He looks big and strong when he's flexing,” someone opined. “But when he sits down, his muscles all sag and he just looks deformed.”</p>

					<p>It's easy to look back at pictures of Schwarzenegger and recognize the features that set him apart, and the skillful ways he displayed them. But his greatest feat was being Arnold.</p>

					<p>“Arnold took bodybuilding out of the sideshow category by sheer force of his personality,” says TC Luoma, editor-in-chief of t-nation.com. “His charisma and his never-before-seen physique even appealed to the average guy whose only experience with weights was with a Nautilus machine.”</p>

					<p>Once we'd seen that physique, and gotten a sense of the showman who built it, it changed our perception of both muscularity and masculinity.</p>
					<h4>Ronnie Coleman</h4>
					<img class="arnold_history" src="Images/Ronnie1.jpg" alt="Ronnie Coleman  at a bodybuidling competition">
				
						<p> Way back in the 1930s, John Grimek resisted gaining the 20 to 30 pounds he would've needed to be an Olympic weightlifting champion. He liked his waistline just the way it was.</p>

						<p>Seventy years later, the pursuit of freaky mass led to an epidemic of “GH gut” (growth hormone gut) among top bodybuilders, including eight-time Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman.</p>

						<p>A police officer in Arlington, Texas, Coleman was by all accounts one of the most genetically gifted individuals in the history of the sport. Whether he was ever truly “natural”—as he claimed he was at the beginning of his bodybuilding career—is open to debate.</p>

						<p>When he started serious training in 1989, he was 5-11, 215. By 1990, when he entered his first amateur contest, he was up to 230. He reportedly competed at 297 in the early 2000s.</p>

						<p>That kind of mass, with no visible body fat, should've been impossible. He had muscles in places where the rest of us don't even have places.</p>

						<p>Coleman, along with his contemporaries and their successors, “passed from somewhat freakish to otherworldly freakish,” Luoma says. “Their bodies, too, began to resemble each other. Whereas bodybuilders in Arnold's day were often known for having a body part that was more developed or particularly aesthetic, this new genre all looked the same.”</p>

						<p>That opened the door for something different.</p>
					
					<h4> Von Moger and Steve Cook</h4>
					<img class="arnold_history" src="Images/Von_Moger.jpg" alt="Von Moger flexing his lats on a mountain side">
					<p> Von Moger (shown above) is a 25-year-old Australian who invites comparisons to Schwarzenegger.</p>

						<p>Cook (shown below) is a 31-year-old former college football player who invites comparisons to Steve Reeves, aiming for the smallest possible waist and equal circumference of the neck, upper arms, and calves.</p>

						<p>Both are popular on social media, and neither has expressed any interest in gaining the kind of size it would take to compete with the mass monsters for the major bodybuilding titles. It's their physiques that lifters today are more likely to aspire to.</p>
